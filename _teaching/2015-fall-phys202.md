Physics 202 at Washington State University (WSU) is a calculus-based course titled **Physics for Scientists and Engineers II**. It primarily covers topics in electricity, magnetism, electromagnetics, DC and AC circuits, and optics¹³. 

The course includes detailed lectures on:
- **Electrostatics**: Electric charge, Coulomb’s law, electric fields, Gauss’s law, electric potential energy, and electric potential.
- **Magnetostatics and Electromagnetism**: Magnetism, electric current, Ampere’s force law, Biot–Savart law, Gauss’s law for magnetism, Ampere’s law, Lorentz force law, relativity of fields, electromagnetic induction, and Maxwell's equations.
- **Electrical Circuits**: Electrical networks, Kirchhoff’s laws, wires, batteries, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and various types of circuits (RC, RL, AC, LC).
- **Waves and Optics**: Wave equation, solutions to the wave equation, superposition, waves in multiple dimensions, wave optics, and geometrical optics¹.
